    <p>William Walcher has been capturing the beauty of the world through his lens for as long as he can remember.
      Ever since taking his first picture, Walcher was hooked and brought a camera along on all his trips to capture memories.
      Although Walcher started photographing on his own, he seized the opportunity to take formal photography classes during his Junior and Senior years of high school.
      Walcher’s favorite subjects include macro and wildlife photography. Walcher has an acute eye for the intricacies of everyday items.
      He has learned how to use the camera’s power to freeze time, giving the ability to capture animals and nature in motion.
      Photography is primarily a hobby of Walcher’s at the moment. Walcher hopes to learn and experiment more, in order to continue capturing the movement and detail in things that are often overlooked.
