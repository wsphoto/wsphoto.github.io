    <center><h4><b>Long Exposure - Neon Grooves</b></h4>
			<p>As a lover of music, I collect records in my spare time. I love the look, feel, and sense of ownership that come along with vinyl records. <br>
      You can usually find me playing a record and relaxing to it in my room at the end of every day. That's where my idea for this photo sparked. <br>
      While I was listening to a record I thought - wouldn't it be cool if I could capture the motion of a record spinning with light? The result is this piece, called Neon Grooves. <br>
      I managed to capture the same grooves and texture of a record, while capturing the spinnning motion of a disc on a turntable.

  <div class="slidepf"><img class="slideimage" src="images/fulls/flag.jpg"><br>
    <center><h4><b>Double Exposure - Star Spangled</b></h4>
      <p>As I watched a flag wave in the wind, I contemplated what this symbol means to so many. <br>
      I wanted this image to convey the American mantra of “E Pluribus Unum,” or, “out of many, one.” In order to do this the best, I chose to make the image a double exposure.<br>
      In our divided nation, this has been an important thing to remember--we are all united under the same flag regardless of our race, creed, or background. <br>
      By showing the flag in multiple stages in one piece it represents that it takes all of us, regardless of our difference, to make a whole nation.

    <center><h4><b>Low Key - In Control</b></h4>
      <p>In my free time outside of photography, I enjoy occassionally DJ-ing for fun!<br>
      This picture was an attempt to capture the intricacies of a DJ controller that might go unnoticed by someone unfamiliar with the craft. <br>
      I chose to make the image low key because I felt that it added a sense of focus to the piece that it did not have in color.

  <div class="slidepf"><img class="slideimagebokeh" src="images/fulls/bokehglass.jpg"><br>
    <center><h4><b>Bokeh - Libation</b></h4>
		<p>In this image, I attempted to capture a feeling of emptiness. <br>
    The use of bokeh in the image allowed me to contrast the warmth and fullness of light with the void of the glass. <br>
    In our lives, we often find ourselves chaasing after what we deem will make us happy, when in reality, it will not. <br>
    Instead of being thankful for the things we have, we can often lose sight of what really matters in life, and find ourselves with an empty glass. <br>
    This image serves as a reminder to stop and be thankful.
